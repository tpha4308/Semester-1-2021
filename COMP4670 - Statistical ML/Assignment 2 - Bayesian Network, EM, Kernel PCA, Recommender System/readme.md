# Assignment 2

For assignment 2, there are 3 question to complete. A description is included below.

**DUE DATE**: 17 May 11:59 Canberra Time.

## How to submit/package files:

Submission is through gradescope.

To submit run `python3 ./package_submission.py`. Any additional files you use in the assignment **must** be put into the `./submission_extras` folder (and appropriate paths attached in notebooks). However **no extra code files** should be included.

## Important notes:

 - All functions which have randomisation **requires random seeds to be specified**! Mark deduction will be made if this is not the case.
 - When asked to define functions or classes **do not** use any global variables. Only those which are presented in the input. Failure to do so may result in full mark penalties.
 - Plots **must be appropriately labelled**. Deduction apply.
 - **Do not** change the inputs of any of the skeleton code given. Full mark deduction may apply as a result.
 - For any files read in your functions, make sure to use a **relative path** from the root directory created from extracting the assignment.

## Question Breakdown:

### Question 1: Bayesian Networks and EM

In the following questions we will be considering a Bayesian Network for modelling variables related to students' ability to get a job (note this is a toy example aiming to encode a few simple intuitions, the values are randomly made).

### Question 2: Kernel PCA

Background content related to this question can be found in Sections 12.1.4 and 12.3 of Bishop's book.

### Question 3: Recommender systems using AutoRec


## Mark breakdown:

 - Q1 [40 = 4 + 6 + 10 + 10 + 10]
 - Q2 [30 = 5 + 5 + 10 + 5 + 5]
 - Q3 [30 = 2 + 5 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 9]
